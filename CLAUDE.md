## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 3, Lesson 4 (E2E Tests)

**For E2E tests, use the two M3L4 skills in this order:**

1. **`/10x-e2e-setup`** — one-time setup: Playwright config (`webServer`,
   auth `setup` project, `storageState`), a green seed test, and `context/foundation/test-stack.md`.
2. **`/10x-e2e`** — the per-risk loop: risk → explore the running app with
   `playwright-cli` → generate → review against the five anti-patterns →
   re-prompt by name → verify with a deliberate break.

The skills' `references/` carry the full rules, anti-patterns, seed pattern, and
prompt-template.

A few hard rules that hold even before you invoke the skill:

- **Locators:** `getByRole` / `getByLabel` / `getByText` first; `getByTestId`
  only when accessibility attributes are ambiguous. Never CSS selectors, XPath,
  or DOM structure.
- **Never `page.waitForTimeout()`.** Wait for state: `toBeVisible()`,
  `waitForURL()`, `waitForResponse()`.
- **Test independence + cleanup.** Each test runs standalone — its own setup,
  action, assertion, and cleanup; unique ids (timestamp suffix) so parallel runs
  and re-runs don't collide.

Two boundaries to keep straight:

- **DOM (snapshot) is the default.** Vision (`--caps=vision`) is a supplement for
  visual-only risks (layout, z-index, animation); for pixel regression prefer
  deterministic tools (`toHaveScreenshot`, Argos, Lost Pixel). VLM model
  selection/cost is a debugging topic (Lesson 5), not testing.
- **A red test is a signal, not a chore.** A changed selector → update the
  locator in a reviewed diff. A changed business behavior → the test caught a
  bug; never edit the assertion to match it. Fixing failing tests is Lesson 5.

## Phase gate: review before the next phase

After `/10x-implement` finishes a phase (gates green, phase committed), **stop and run `/10x-impl-review <change-id> phase <N>`** before starting phase N+1, and triage its findings. Never chain one phase's implementation straight into the next, even when the user picks "continue" in the next-phase prompt or asks for several phases in a row; offer the review first and continue only once it is done or the user explicitly skips it for that phase.
